# Pipe VMS Chile pipeline

This repository contains the peruvian VMS API consumption pipeline. 

# Running

## Dependencies

You just need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in your machine to run the
pipeline. No other dependency is required.

## Setup

The pipeline reads it's input from BigQuery, so you need to first authenticate
with your google cloud account inside the docker images. To do that, you need
to run this command and follow the instructions:

```
docker-compose run gcloud auth login
```

## CLI

The pipeline includes a CLI that can be used to start both local test runs and
remote full runs. Just run `docker-compose run pipeline --help` and follow the
instructions there.
